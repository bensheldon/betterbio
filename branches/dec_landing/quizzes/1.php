<header><h1>Which of these is clinically proven to help prevent and heal the common cold?</h1></header>
<dl>
  <dt>Zinc</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. For now, the study results on using zinc as a cold remedy are inconclusive. For every study 
    showing a positive benefit with zinc, there’s another study showing no benefit at all. In fact, it’s 
    believed that if there is any benefit in taking zinc or zinc lozenges, it is very minor. This is why

  <dt>Echinacea purporea</dt> 
  <dd>CORRECT. University of Connecticut researchers put the theory to the test recently, and after studying 
    more than 1,600 people, they reported that not only did echinacea cut the chances of catching a cold in 
    half, but also those study participants who took it reduced the duration of their colds by about 1.4 days.

  <dt>TRIM21</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. Though recent research did prove that antibodies actually work inside human cells, which was a 
    scientific breakthrough, no one has figured out how to actually turn this into a therapy - in other words, 
    we know it happens, but don't know how we'd turn it into a medicine we could give people. This is why we're 
    here - to help separate scientific fact from fiction and bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
  <dt>Vitamin C</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. for most: A major review of more than 30 studies conducted by researchers at Australian National 
    University and the University of Helsinki say that for the majority of people, vitamin C does nothing to 
    prevent or reduce the symptoms of a cold. However, if you’re under a lot of stress, or are putting your 
    body to the test—for example, training for a marathon—a daily dose of 200 mg of vitamin C may reduce your 
    chances of catching a cold by about half. This is why we're here - to help separate scientific fact from 
    fiction and bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
