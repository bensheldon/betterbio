    <!-- <header><h1>Which of these is clinically proven to help prevent and heal the common cold?</h1></header>
    <dl>
      <dt>Zinc</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. For now, the study results on using zinc as a cold remedy are inconclusive. For every study 
        showing a positive benefit with zinc, there’s another study showing no benefit at all. In fact, it’s 
        believed that if there is any benefit in taking zinc or zinc lozenges, it is very minor. This is why 
        we're here - to help separate scientific fact from fiction and bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>Echinacea purporea</dt> 
      <dd>CORRECT. University of Connecticut researchers put the theory to the test recently, and after studying 
        more than 1,600 people, they reported that not only did echinacea cut the chances of catching a cold in 
        half, but also those study participants who took it reduced the duration of their colds by about 1.4 days. 
        This is why we're here - to help separate scientific fact from fiction and bridge the life science 
        knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>TRIM21</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. Though recent research did prove that antibodies actually work inside human cells, which was a 
        scientific breakthrough, no one has figured out how to actually turn this into a therapy - in other words, 
        we know it happens, but don't know how we'd turn it into a medicine we could give people. This is why we're 
        here - to help separate scientific fact from fiction and bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>Vitamin C</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. for most: A major review of more than 30 studies conducted by researchers at Australian National 
        University and the University of Helsinki say that for the majority of people, vitamin C does nothing to 
        prevent or reduce the symptoms of a cold. However, if you’re under a lot of stress, or are putting your 
        body to the test—for example, training for a marathon—a daily dose of 200 mg of vitamin C may reduce your 
        chances of catching a cold by about half. This is why we're here - to help separate scientific fact from 
        fiction and bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>

    <!-- <header><h1>What is DNA?</h1></header>
    <dl>
      <dt>Drug and Narcotics Agency</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. It is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning 
        of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. However, some Americans guessed this answer 
        in a 2003 survey, where less than one-third knew that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life. This is 
        why we're here - to help bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>Deoxyribonucleic acid</dt> 
      <dd>CORRECT. It is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning 
        of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. However, less than one-third of Americans 
        know that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life. This is why we're here - to help bridge the life 
        science knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>The chemicals that make up an atom</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. Those are the proton, the neutron and the electron. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid 
        that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms, 
        with the exception of some viruses. Less than one-third of Americans know that DNA is a basic genetic building 
        block of life. This is why we're here - to help bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
      <dt>Dopamine Neurological Associations</dt>
      <dd>FALSE. However, this is a better answer than Drug and Narcotics Agency, which some Americans think! Less than 
        one-third of Americans know that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life.  DNA is actually 
        deoxyribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and 
        functioning of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. This is why we're here - to

    (Small Headshot Picture of Me)
    *Animation.*

    In order to get a job in this "innovation economy," you need real reporting that goes beyond soundbites.

    In order to secure the health of your family and community, you need real answers, not press releases.

    And in order lead a talented team of journalists so they can provide you with the news you need, I need you.

    *End animation*

    How can a nonprofit, independent news outlet provide in-depth, accessible reporting on these complex issues, especially when conventional media providers have abandoned biotech coverage?

    It can't, unless you help us out.  And it must, because the mainstream media won't.

    Please donate today and become part of the solution.  Before the end of this year, we need 500 people to step up and say yes, I will support BetterBio. Will you be one of them? We know some of you are struggling just to make ends meet, so remember: even a gift of $5 will make a difference. Donate the most you can, and we will put it to its maximum use.  Click here to help us get started.

    Because our work is sponsored by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, your donation is tax deductible - so don't wait to receive your tax benefit - donate now.  

    If you can't afford to donate but believe in what we're doing, please make a pledge or join our referral program, in which we thank you for your hard fundraising work with prizes for referring in donations at different levels.  See our fundraising campaign site for more details.
    However you participate, know how grateful we are to have you involved, and how committed we are to delivering on our promise.

    Thank you for helping us make life better - for all of us.
    -Khadijah Britton, Founder.
