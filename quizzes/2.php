  <dt>Drug and Narcotics Agency</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. It is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning 
    of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. However, some Americans guessed this answer 
    in a 2003 survey, where less than one-third knew that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life. This is 
    why we're here - to help bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
  <dt>Deoxyribonucleic acid</dt> 
  <dd>CORRECT. It is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning 
    of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. However, less than one-third of Americans 
    know that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life. This is why we're here - to help bridge the life 
    science knowledge gap!</dd>
  <dt>The chemicals that make up an atom</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. Those are the proton, the neutron and the electron. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid 
    that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms, 
    with the exception of some viruses. Less than one-third of Americans know that DNA is a basic genetic building 
    block of life. This is why we're here - to help bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
  <dt>Dopamine Neurological Associations</dt>
  <dd>FALSE. However, this is a better answer than Drug and Narcotics Agency, which some Americans think! Less than 
    one-third of Americans know that DNA is a basic genetic building block of life.  DNA is actually 
    deoxyribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and 
    functioning of all known living organisms, with the exception of some viruses. This is why we're here - to 
    help bridge the life science knowledge gap!</dd>
